# Simple Fast Image Compression
SFIC is a simple image compression library made with C++, it
is design to be easy to integrate into your code, and it enables max compression
but with speed in mind. As part of the image compression, it also includes
different compression algorithms such as Huffman Encoding and LZ77. The best characteristic
of this library is that it is extremely modular, if you only need a compression algorithm
just install the one you need, it is also really lightweight and it does not require
external libraries.  Installation
`
make

make install
